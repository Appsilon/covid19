The goal of this dashboard is to provide an epidemiological overview of the COVID-19 pandemic, incorporating data from multiple sources. 

It is being actively developed by the data science team at [Epicentre MSF](https://epicentre.msf.org/en).

Future plans include more detailed analysis at sub-national levels and incorporation of data collected at MSF hospitals.

The tool is built using the R programming language and the shiny web framework. Packages used include the tidyverse, leaflet and highcharter.
